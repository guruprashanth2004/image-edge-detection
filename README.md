# Canny Edge Detection with OpenCV in Google Colab

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to perform Canny Edge Detection using the OpenCV library in Python.

## Description

The notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of Canny Edge Detection, a popular computer vision technique used to identify edges in images. It covers the following steps:

1. Installing OpenCV.
2. Uploading an image to the Colab environment.
3. Reading the image in grayscale.
4. Applying the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.
5. Displaying the original and edge-detected images.

## Requirements

- Google Colab account
- Basic understanding of Python and OpenCV

## Usage

1. Open this notebook in Google Colab.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially.
3. Upload an image when prompted by the file upload dialog.
4. Observe the original and edge-detected images displayed in the output.

## Example

The notebook includes an example demonstrating Canny Edge Detection on a sample image. You can replace this image with your own to experiment with different inputs.
